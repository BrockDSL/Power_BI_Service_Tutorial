# Power BI Service
Power BI Service is the online version of Microsofts Power BI.  This version of the software is not as versatile as Power BI Desktop but it still provides powerful data visualization and analysis too and can be used to build both reports and dashboards.  Access to both the desktop version and online version of Power BI is available to Brock University students as part of their Office 365 subscription.  This tutorial will walk you through the following steps:
1. Importing Data
2. Creating a report with your data
3. Making visualizations with your data
4. Using Filters to focus on certain aspects of the data
5. Asking question of your data using the built in AI
6. Making a dashboard out of your visualizations
7. Using the Quick Insights tool
8. Editing your Dashboard with tiles
9. Saving your dashboard


### Setup
The first step for this tutorial is getting on to Power BI Service.  Navigate to [app.powerbi.com](https://app.powerbi.com/home) and login using your brock id to login.  Once you have logged in click on the "new look" slider at the top of the screen.  You are welcome to use the old look if you prefer but be aware that your screen may not look like the screenshots in this tutorial and the location of some menus are different.   Next, right click on [This Link](Sample_Data.xlsx) and select "Save as..." and save the file to your computer.

### Getting Data
Click on the "Get Data" button at the bottom right of the scree.  Under the "Create new content" heading select "Get" under files.  Choose "Local File" and choose the sample dataset.  Click the "Import" button and your data will now be available in Power BI.

### Reports

Reports in Power BI are where you will spend most of your time building visualizations and looking at the data.  Navigate to your workspace by clicking "My Workspace" on the left menu.  Click on the "Datasets" tab and find your sample data.  To create a new report from your dataset, click on the bar graph icon under the actions header as seen below.

![Create Report Button][scrn1]

You should now be in the Report View with your data loaded.  On the right hand side you will see three menus: "Filters", "Visualizations", and "Fields".

Fields is the area where you determine wich columns of data will be included in your visualizations.  The Visualizations menu is where you add new visualizations to your report, change what type of visualization is being used in the selected tile, and edit the attributes of the selected visualization.  Filters are used to narrow down the focus in the selected tile so that you can look at data from select rows instead of entire columns.

![Adjustment Menu's][scrn2]

To create a visualization, select the type that you want to make from the visualizations menu, select the data that you want to be used in the visualization, and adjust the size of the newly created tile by dragging the corners of the box.  In the example below we created a pie chart containing the sales per country and resized it to be visible.  Another way to create a visualization is to select the data first and let Power BI decide what form is best suited to the type of data that you have selected.  To make another visualization, click on an empty space in your report so that nothing is selected, and the go through the steps again.  The contents of a visualization can be changed by selecting it (click on the white space in the tile) and then changing your selections in the Fields menu.

![First Visualization][scrn3]

To focus your visualizations on a more specific subject within the data selected from the Fields menu, we use the drop down lists in the Filters menu.  By using filters you can compare specific sections of your data more easily.
